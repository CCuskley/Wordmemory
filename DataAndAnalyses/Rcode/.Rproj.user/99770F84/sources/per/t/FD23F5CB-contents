# This code was written by Jenny C, A. Read in Rstudio Version 1.2.1335 using R version 3.6.0 (2019-04-26).

# All code you will want to run is in folder "src"
# All functions called by this code are in folder "lib"
# All output (results files, graphs and Word docs) are written to folder "output"

# This is the processing pipeline:

# Run the code from within src. Assuming the working directory is currently the top-level folder where this
# Readme.R file is located, all you'll need is:
setwd("src")

# First, edit src/SetUp.R to make sure that the variables "datadir" and "pptinfo" point
# to the folder containing the raw data files, and the participant info document, respectively.

# Then to fit ROC curves to all the raw data, run the file src/FitAllData.R:
source("FitAllData.R")
# This goes through all files in the datadir folder, and fits them. It saves the results in a csv file
# named something like RunAnalysisResults20210121T123638.csv in folder "output".
# The timestamp means that you won't overwrite old results if you run the file again.
# I did this because FitAllData takes a while to run.
# But it also writes the results into a file called RunAnalysisResults_MostRecent.csv
# which gets overwritten every time.

# To match up the data files with participant information stored in the "pptinfo" file,
# modify the file MatchUpWithPptData.R to ensure that the variable "fitfiles" points to the
# fits file you want to use, whether
# fitsfile = "../output/RunAnalysisResults_MostRecent.csv"
# or a different fits file.

# The "pptinfo" file also contains information on participants' time to completion.
# MatchUpWithPptData.R also takes the opportunity to remove participants whose time to completion was too long or short.
# This is done via the variable 'removeOutlyingPercent' which specifies the total
# percentage to remove. For example, if removeOutlyingPercent=10, then the slowest
# 5% and fastest 5% of participants will be removed from further analysis.


source("MatchUpWithPptData.R")
# This writes the results to output/results.csv
# Note that this will be overwritten

# Finally, to generate graphs, do
rmarkdown::render(input = "PlotGraphs.Rmd",output_file="../output/Results.docx")
