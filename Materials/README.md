This is folder contans code to run the experiment, which you can demo at https://exps-main.herokuapp.com/wmdemo (Note that this demo uses the lowStart_even condition for stimuli invariably, but the code released here chooses randomly between word lists).

The code is designed to deploy on Heroku and work with MongoDB, though it is adaptable. For detailed documentation on how to use this code, see https://lead-ncl.gitbook.io/word-memory-and-recollection

This code was adapted from the free Quick Jinja UI template https://theme-jinja2-quick-uikit.appseed.us/, which is released under an MIT license. The license can be found under template-readme/LICENSE.md, alongside other README files released with the template.
